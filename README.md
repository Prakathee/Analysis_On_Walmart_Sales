# Analysis_On_Walmart_Sales

Walmart is a global retailer with over 11,000 stores in 27 countries, employing over 2.3 million
people and serving over 265 million customers per week. Its business model focuses on
providing low prices and a wide variety of products, including groceries, apparel, electronics,
and home goods. Walmart has also expanded into e-commerce, with rapidly growing online
sales.

This project uses advanced statistics to analyze Walmart's sales data for strategic insights. It
identifies trends and patterns, investigating factors like holidays and temperature to suggest ways
for Walmart to improve sales. Using generalized linear models and clustering analysis, it
develops accurate predictions and identifies key factors for sales performance.

Based on the analysis, we came to the conclusion that there are several factors that impact Walmart's
weekly sales. Holidays, especially Thanksgiving and the week before Christmas, have a
significant positive impact on sales. However, other festivals did not have a significant effect.
Fuel prices and unemployment have a weak negative correlation with Sales. There are some
outliers in the non-holiday weeks, indicating some weeks with exceptionally high or low sales.
The analysis also identified some stores that are negatively correlated with weekly sales.
